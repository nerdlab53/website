            it feels like just yesterday when i was wandering in my college as a freshman, sometimes building stuff in the robotics lab, chilling with my seniors, organizing robotics competitions etc. <br>
            <br>
            my college wasn't that great, i mean it's a tier 3 college but i have loved every bit of this life, and I will always be grateful for it as it did provide me with good enough opportunities. <br>
            <br>
            even learning ML, although i was alone and no body was doing it at the time, i just used to have fun learning about this interesting field, where the math was so lovable and tell my friends about it and helping them get started themselves. <br>
            <br>
            i've met people here who will probably be a part of my life for a long long time and i love all of these guys. <br>
            <br>
            it's been one heck of a ride and i'd agree to do it all again in a split second. i've got one last chance to organize the robotics competitions this year, let's see how it goes. <br>
            <br>
            one. last. time.
